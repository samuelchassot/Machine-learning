\section{Introduction}
The goal of the project was to classify a set of tweets as positive or negative content. We try to use different methods to achieve this goal:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SVM
  \item SGD
  \item Neural Nets
\end{itemize}

\section{Embedding and Neural Nets}
The first part is to transform each tweets in a vector. We first try using an implementation of the GloVE algorithm of our own, the results are not very satisfiing (65\%-70\%). We then use an embedding created by the Stanford University which is also based on GloVE and that used a big Twitter dataset. We decide to use the 200 features version.
