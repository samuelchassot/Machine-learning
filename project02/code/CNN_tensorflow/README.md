# Convolutional Neural Networks Notebook

## Depedencies
This notebook require the following :
Either : 
- Google Colab
Either :
- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow 2.0 or/and tensorflow-gpu depending on your computer and all its dependencies
- Keras

## Datasets
Provided datasets must be extracted into a folder named `Datasets`.

You should download the twitter word vectors from : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ .
In this notebook, we use the 200D vectors.

## How to run ?
The execution is trivial, run interactively the cells.

# Overview
This notebook contains methods to clean the data and 3 main models to create a convolutional neural network.
