# Logistic Regression and Support-Vector machine jupyter notebooks

## Depedencies
These notebooks require the following :
- Python 3.8
- Jupyter-Notebook
- Natural Language Toolkit
- Scikit-learn

## Datasets
Provided datasets must be extracted into a folder named `Datasets`

## How to run ?
The execution is trivial, run interactively the cells.

# Overview
- `simple_lr` and `simple_svm` : 1-grams with all cleaning and normalization methods
- `better_svm` : compare multiple vectorizations with svm
- `final_svm` : final optimization of svm with 3 and 4-grams for aicrowd submissions
- `simple_graphs` : used to generate the plots in the report
