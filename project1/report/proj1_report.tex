\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning
methods learned in class on a real dataset. We take a
strong interest in testing a lot of techniques and
comparing their results. This comparison encourage us to
tweak hyperparameters and check their effectiveness using
cross-validation.

We do not use least\_squaresi\_SGD because we consider
that it would provide us results really close to other
methods we already us. Finally, we assess the following
methods.

\begin{itemize}
  \item least\_squares
  \item least\_squares\_GD 
  \item ridge\_regression
  \item logistic\_regression
  \item reg\_logistic\_regression
\end{itemize}
